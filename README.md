- **User Details Screen**: Provides more detailed information about the selected user, such as their address and company details.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Dynamically loads more users as you scroll down.
- **Navigation**: Allows smooth navigation between the user list and details screen.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles API failures.
- **Modern UI**: Features a clean, responsive, and visually appealing design.
## Features
### User List Screen
